# Family Background:

I come from a fully Irish background, with my family hailing from Belfast, Northern Ireland. My dad and his parents were born there. I grew up in Barrie, moved to Sarnia in Grade 9, and now live independently in London for college. A fun fact: my late uncle played soccer for Northern Ireland and even met George Best!

# Hobbies:

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer (I’m a huge Arsenal fan), practicing & watching MMA. One of the things I love doing is working on my businesses. Firstly my clothing brand, twentyfourhoursricher. Secondly my app called Hawkeye. HawkEye is a lead generation and data analysis app designed for realtors to help streamline their business and find potential clients more efficiently. Since I am very fascinated by how tech can solve problems, diving into this idea has been tons of fun. Lastly, my media agency AllTheMedia, is another creative outlet for me. I enjoy working with clients on various media projects, whether it’s content creation, branding, or video production.  Overall, I just love exploring different ways to be creative, whether it's through media, fashion, or tech.

# Skills:

I’ve developed a diverse skill set, especially in: Graphic Design & Branding: I’m well-versed in creating compelling brand identities, from logos to merchandise design. User Interface (UI) Design: I have experience designing intuitive and engaging app interfaces that enhance user experiences. Video Editing & VFX: I specialize in creating high-quality video content, integrating visual effects and mixed media to tell captivating stories.

# What’s next 
I’m focused on building up my skills to improve the way I serve clients and deepen my knowledge in an industry that I’m truly passionate about. I also plan to expand my network, making valuable connections with peers and using those relationships to grow and create new opportunities.
